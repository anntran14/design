    <p><strong>overview</strong></p>

<p>If books are the heart of publishing, marketing is the blood. Marketing circulates books into the hands of buyers, distributers, and other channels.</p>

<p>Marketing has a lot of pieces, and one that I worked with was building promotional web tools. Microsites, which are more simplistic and easy to navigate than a general website, are used to highlight giveaways or target specific buyer audiences. Newsletters will regularly communicate with the buyer, so it is important they are uncluttered and focused.</p>

<p><strong>design analysis</strong></p>

<p>Bookperk is a promotional e-book newsletter that shares e-book deals, handpicked recommendations, and updates from HarperCollins authors. The <a href="http://www.bookperk.com/">earlier Bookperk site</a> has cropped graphics, an intense color palette, and and a background that feels vaguely outdated. The Bookperk team wanted something that clarified what the company was and directed the users to a call-to-action.</p>

	<img class="col-alt one-alt" style="height:380px;" src="/img/bookperk/1-timeless.jpg" alt="" title="Microsite Traditional Wireframe" />
	<img class="col-alt one-alt" style="height:380px;" src="/img/bookperk/2-modern.jpg" object-fit="fill" alt="" title="Microsite Modern Wireframe" />
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
The Bookperk team requested two options. On the left, this design would incorporate classic elements and shapes with a clean modern backdrop. The option on the right contains less text, and would have more visual cues. 
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, the tight timeline limited design exploration. However, the team was very happy with the options. From here, I would build two prototypes: one more classic and literary, and one more clean and simple.</p>

<p><strong>prototype and release</strong></p>

<p>As a final step, to demonstrate what the site and newsletter may look like, I developed a stylized version of the site.</p>

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" style="height:350px;" src="/img/bookperk/booksplash.jpg" alt="" title="Updated Booksplash" />
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
An updated booksplash I designed. The staggered covers are more dynamic and the larger jackets display the diversity of books available on Bookperk. </div>

	<img class="col-alt two-alt" style="height:350px;" src="/img/bookperk/landingpage-modern.jpg" alt="" title="Microsite Modern Prototype" />
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
On the left, the landing page with a classic, more literary approach. On the right, the modern, simple option. </div>

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col-alt one-alt" style="height:500px;" src="/img/bookperk/landingpage-classic.jpg" alt="" title="Microsite Traditional Prototype" />
	<img class="col-alt one-alt" style="height:500px;" src="/img/bookperk/landingpage-modern.jpg" alt="" title="Microsite Modern Prototype" />
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
On the left, the landing page with a classic, more literary approach. On the right, the modern, simple option. </div>

<p>Once our team got clearance for this, we build the webiste using Beaver Builder, a software in Wordpress. You can view the <a href="https://info.harpercollins.com/kisscon/">updated KissCon site here</a>.</p>
